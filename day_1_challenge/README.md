# Challenge

The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific **calibration value** that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the **first digit** and the **last digit** (in that order) to form a single **two-digit number**.
Consider your entire calibration document. **What is the sum of all of the calibration values?**

It looks like some of the digits are actually **spelled out with letters**: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
